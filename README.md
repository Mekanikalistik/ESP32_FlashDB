# ESP32_FlashDB Project

This project integrates and demonstrates the FlashDB ultra-lightweight embedded database library on an ESP32 microcontroller using the ESP-IDF framework. It includes a custom Flash Abstraction Layer (FAL) port for ESP32 and a `main.c` application to test Key-Value (KVDB) and Time Series Database (TSDB) functionalities.

The primary goal of this project is to provide a ready-to-use example and a modular component for FlashDB on ESP-IDF, ensuring its proper configuration and operation.
